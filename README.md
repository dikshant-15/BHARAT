# Titanic Classification :
A system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking and what factors were most likely lead to success--- socio-economic status, age, gender and more.

## Introduction:
The tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. In this GitHub project, we present a classification system that aims to predict passenger survival and uncover the key factors that were most likely to lead to success. Our model utilizes a dataset containing various passenger attributes, such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more, to make informed predictions.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project consists of information about Titanic passengers, including their socio-economic status, age, gender, cabin class, ticket fare, and whether they survived or not. This data provides valuable insights into the demographics of the passengers and allows us to analyze the factors contributing to their survival.

## Classification Model:
We employ machine learning techniques to build a classification model that predicts passenger survival. The primary algorithm used for this task is the Random Forest classifier, known for its ability to handle complex datasets and identify significant features.

## Key Features:
Our classification model is designed to identify the most important features that influenced the likelihood of survival. The following factors are analyzed in detail:

##### Socio-economic Status: 
We investigate whether passengers' socio-economic status, such as class and ticket fare, played a crucial role in their chances of survival.
#### Age and Gender: 
The influence of age and gender on passenger survival is examined to understand if certain demographics had a higher likelihood of being saved.
#### Cabin Class:
We analyze the correlation between cabin class and survival, exploring whether those in higher classes had better chances of survival.
#### Family Size:
The impact of family size on survival rates is studied, determining whether being accompanied by family members affected one's survival prospects.
#### Embarked Port: 
The point of embarkation is explored to see if it played a role in determining passenger survival.

## Results and Visualizations:
The GitHub repository includes interactive visualizations and insightful graphs to showcase the findings of our analysis. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of the relationships between different features and passenger survival.
